Description
===========
Configures squid as a caching proxy.

Recipes
=======
default
-------
The default recipe installs squid and sets up simple proxy caching. As of now, the options you may change are the port (`node['squid']['port']`) and the network the caching proxy is available on the subnet from `node.ipaddress` (ie. "192.168.1.0/24") but may be overridden with `node['squid']['network']`. The size of objects allowed to be stored has been bumped up to allow for caching of installation files.

Usage
=====
Include the squid recipe on the server. Other nodes may search for this node as their caching proxy and use the `node.ipaddress` and `node['squid']['port']` to point at it.

Databags are able to be used for storing host & url acls and also which hosts/nets are able to access which hosts/url

Example Databags
================

squid_urls - yubikey item
-------------------------
{
  "urls": [
    "^https://api.yubico.com/wsapi/2.0/verify"
  ],
  "id": "yubikey"
}

squid_hosts - bastion item
--------------------------
{
  "type": "src",
  "id": "bastion",
  "net": [
    "192.168.0.2/32"
  ]
}

squid_acls - bastion item
-------------------------
{
  "id": "bastion",
  "acl": [
    [
      "yubikey",
      "allow"
    ],
    [
